# Public Transportation IoT Integration Project

## Overview

This project aims to enhance the efficiency and quality of public transportation services by integrating IoT sensors into public transportation vehicles. The system monitors ridership, tracks vehicle locations, and predicts arrival times, providing real-time transit information to the public through a user-friendly platform.

## Objective

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

- Monitor ridership in real-time.
- Track the locations of public transportation vehicles.
- Predict arrival times for passengers.
- Enhance the efficiency and quality of public transportation services.

## Requirements

To set up and run this project, you'll need the following:

- IoT sensors and hardware (e.g., GPS modules, occupancy sensors).
- Microcontrollers (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Arduino).
- Python 3.x and necessary libraries for sensor data processing.
- Web development tools and frameworks (if developing a user platform).
- Communication modules (e.g., Wi-Fi, cellular, LoRa).
- Database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for storing data.
- Necessary permissions and approvals for installing sensors in public transportation vehicles.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the IoT sensors and hardware as per the project requirements.
3. Install the necessary Python libraries for sensor data processing.
4. Develop the real-time transit information platform using web development tools and frameworks.
5. Configure communication modules for data transmission.
6. Integrate IoT sensors with the platform.
7. Deploy the IoT sensors in public transportation vehicles.
8. Test the system thoroughly and debug any issues.
9. Ensure data privacy and security measures are in place.
10. Educate passengers and stakeholders about the platform's availability and benefits.
